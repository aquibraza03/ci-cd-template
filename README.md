CI/CD Automation Template for SMEs

Ship software safely, automatically, and without DevOps headaches.

This repository provides a ready-made CI/CD automation framework for small and growing teams who want reliable deployments, built-in security, and predictable workflows — without building everything from scratch.

This is not SaaS.
It is a licensed CI/CD framework + human support.

Who This Is For

This template is designed for:

✅ Startups & SMEs
✅ Small engineering teams (1–20 devs)
✅ Founders who want fewer production issues
✅ Teams using GitHub with AWS / Vercel / Netlify

This is not ideal for:

❌ Large enterprises with custom DevOps platforms
❌ Teams wanting fully DIY pipelines with no standards

The Problem We Solve

Most teams struggle with:

Manual or risky deployments

Different developers doing things differently

Security checks skipped “for speed”

No rollback when production breaks

High DevOps cost for simple needs

This template gives you one proven way of working that removes guesswork.

What You Get

✔ Prebuilt GitHub Actions workflows
✔ Backend, frontend, and microservice support
✔ Secure-by-default pipelines (security always runs)
✔ AWS ECS production deployments (blue-green, zero downtime)
✔ Preview / staging deployments
✔ One-command project setup

In simple terms:

You push code to GitHub

CI automatically builds and tests the app

Security checks run on every change

Safe code is deployed automatically

Deployment status is sent via notifications

No manual steps.
No hidden processes.

Supported Environments

Backend

Node.js / Python

AWS ECS (Mumbai region default)

Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Create a new repository using this template

Add required secrets (see docs/secrets-guide.md)

CI/CD runs automatically 🎉

That’s it.

Security by Default (Important)

Dependency scanning

Container image scanning

Secret detection

Infrastructure checks

Security cannot be skipped by design.

This protects your business even when teams move fast.
